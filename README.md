## 🍕 The Characters

**Josiah** 🧔 — The more cautious one (relatively speaking). Often the voice of reason, which means he gets ignored a lot.

**Graham** 👨‍🦰 — Enthusiastic. Well-meaning. Possesses the kind of confidence that comes from never learning from past mistakes.

**Together** — They share a single braincell, and today it's on vacation.

Made with 🍕 and questionable life choices.

*"We just wanted pizza."* — Josiah, probably
